I would use a camera mounted near the end actuator of the robot, which allows me to identify the location of the object. After that, taking into account that the camera was previously calibrated and its parameters are known. Taking this into account, a procedure is carried out which allows to extract features from the object in order to later determine the pose of the object with respect to the camera, in such a way that the metadata can be converted to the camera's frame of reference. Knowing the metadata with respect to the reference frame of the camera, I would apply an algorithm that performs inverse kinematics calculations, to know the movements that the robot must perform to reach the indicated point.
